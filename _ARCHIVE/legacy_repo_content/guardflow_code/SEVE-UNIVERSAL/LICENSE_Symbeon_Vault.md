SYMBEON-VAULT ADDITIONAL TERMS

The following additional terms apply to the SEVE Framework v3.0 and any derivative works:

ETHICAL USE CLAUSE

By using, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to use it in accordance with the Ethical Manifesto attached to this license. You explicitly agree NOT to use this software for purposes that:

1. Violate human rights or fundamental freedoms
2. Facilitate unlawful surveillance or mass monitoring without proper legal basis
3. Enable discrimination based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics
4. Extract personal data without explicit consent or legal authorization
5. Support oppressive or authoritarian practices
6. Harm individuals or communities

The licensor (Symbeon Tech Ltd.) reserves the right to revoke this license if the software is proven to be used in violation of these ethical principles. Such revocation will be communicated through appropriate channels and may be subject to legal review.

PSEUDONYMITY AND PRIVACY CLAUSE

Any implementation or derivative work of this software that handles personal or sensitive data MUST maintain equivalent pseudonymization/anonymization standards as built into the original design. Specifically:

1. Personal identifiers (names, faces, documents, biometric data) must be pseudonymized or anonymized by default
2. Raw personal data must not be stored without strong encryption and proper access controls
3. The privacy protection mechanisms built into the software (such as face blurring, identity tokenization) must not be removed or disabled
4. Any modifications that handle personal data must maintain or strengthen these privacy protections
5. Logs and datasets must use unique identifiers instead of personal information where possible

Violation of these privacy requirements constitutes a breach of this license and may result in license revocation.

You agree to:

1. Maintain records of how this software is used, particularly regarding data processing and ethical decision-making
2. Provide reasonable access to audit logs upon request from Symbeon Tech or authorized regulatory bodies
3. Cooperate with investigations into potential misuse of the software
4. Report any discovered vulnerabilities or ethical concerns to Symbeon Tech

This license encourages community oversight and responsible use. Users and contributors are encouraged to:

1. Report potential misuse of the software
2. Contribute to the ethical guidelines and best practices
3. Participate in discussions about responsible AI development
4. Share knowledge about ethical implementation patterns

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

While Symbeon Tech strives to ensure the ethical use of this software, the ultimate responsibility for ethical deployment lies with the user. Symbeon Tech disclaims liability for misuse of the software, though we reserve the right to take appropriate action to prevent or stop such misuse.

ETHICAL MANIFESTO FOR SEVE FRAMEWORK

At Symbeon Tech, we believe technology should augment human potential while upholding human values. The SEVE Framework is born from this conviction. Our Ethical Manifesto underscores the following core principles:

PRIVACY BY DESIGN
SEVE is built to protect individual privacy. All personal data processed through the vision system is treated with care – either anonymized, pseudonymized, or otherwise safeguarded. The framework does not output sensitive personal information unless explicitly configured to do so under appropriate consent or legal basis.

FAIR AND UNBIASED AI
SEVE's algorithms and decision rules are developed and tested to minimize bias. We strive for fairness across demographics – the ethical module actively checks for and mitigates biased outcomes.

TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAINABILITY
Decisions made by SEVE are subject to audit. The system can provide explanations for its actions and logs decisions for accountability.

HUMAN-CENTRIC & SYMBIOTIC DESIGN
SEVE is designed to work in tandem with human operators and decision-makers. We emphasize a symbiotic approach where AI enhances human capabilities while humans provide oversight and final judgment.

NO HARMFUL USE
We explicitly discourage and prohibit uses of SEVE that contribute to human rights violations, unlawful surveillance, or any form of harm to individuals or communities.

This Ethical Manifesto is not just philosophy – it's enforced by design and by license. We ask all users and contributors to embrace these principles, ensuring that SEVE remains a force for good in the AI and computer vision landscape.
